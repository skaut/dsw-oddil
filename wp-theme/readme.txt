== Description ==

Basic Wordpress theme for czech scout websites.

In 2012 we noticed that many of the czech scout websites are badly created. Graphically old, not responsive, unusable. So we came together and said NO to old awful websites. After 4 years of inventions and graphic prototypes we have created our template for wide use in scout environment. Use it well and enjoy it!
